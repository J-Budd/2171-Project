# 2171-Project
This is the Github container for the updated version of the Lakespen Basic School DBMS
You should follow the Package diagram so you know which files go in what branch
In each branch there will be a text file identifying code you'll need for the branch. It'll be written in the format of:
- Branch (from the old Github project), File name, Class Name, Function Name (Optional), Lines (Optional)

Usage of AI tools is allowed. Where you do use it, please leave a comment inside the java files detailing the tool you used, what you used it for, and a summarisation of the prompts you used.

Not sure what goes in what branch/package? Very simple:
- Security deals with comparison of an entered username and password to a stored username and password
- UI deals with the GUI aspect. Once you're using awt and swing the file goes here
- Application Logic deals with actual functionality. Think of it as the middleman between the GUI and storage
- Data Persistence deals with the adding, editing and storage of data. Once you're dealing with the constructor of some object, or the reading and writing of a file, it'll go here.
